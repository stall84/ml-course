## High Level Overview of Machine Learning Process

#### Data Pre-Processing
- Import Data (get it into a readable format like .csv, tables, rows, whatever).
- Clean the data (For this course, data comes pre-cleaned). This is an important part of ML Data PreProcessing
- Split data into training and test sets.

#### Modelling
- Build the model
- Train the model
- Make predictions

#### Evaluations
- Calculate performance metrics you want to use against your modeling
- Make a verdict (about the efficacy of model). Repeat process from start if needed.
